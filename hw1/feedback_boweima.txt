-Precarious index calculation. What if reflength = 998? Then end reference string length is 997! Be more rigorous
-Good practice is also to do a sanity check after you create the ref, to see if length matches reflength
CODE:
...
for i in range((reflength * 3/4)):
	ref += gene[random.randint(0, 3)]
ref += ref[halflen:]
